# flappy-bird
A Flappy Bird clone, implemented in Lua with LÖVE engine.

### Extra features added:
* Randomized the gap between pipes (vertical space), such that they’re no longer hardcoded to 90 pixels. 
* Randomized the interval at which pairs of pipes spawn, such that they’re no longer always 2 seconds apart.
* Players awarded with trophies for different points at the end of the game.
* A pause feature implemented when pressed 'P' key. A custom sound plays as other sounds and music stop.
